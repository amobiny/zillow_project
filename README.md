# House Price Prediction Using a Deep Feed-Forward Neural Network

The goal of this mini-project is to construct a model to predict a home’s current market value and score
a test data set with this model. The best result is achieved using a feed-forward neural network with
two hidden layers. This network achieves the mean absolute error value of less than 0.2 on the validation
set. TensorFlow’s Python API is used to create the model.
